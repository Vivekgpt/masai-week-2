                 <b>In Victorian times, certain flowers had specific meanings because the flower selection was limited <br>and people used more symbols and gestures to communicate than words. But today, with so many <br>flower choices, there are no rules – it’s the sentiment that gives the gift its meaning. Your florist can <br>help you send the right message. Many people assign their own personal meanings – a flower or <br>color that might remind them of a special event or moment in their lives. For those interested in the <br>historic meanings of flowers, the Society of American Florists has compiled this list from a variety <br>of different sources.</b>
